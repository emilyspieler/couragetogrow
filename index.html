          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Meet Eira</h2>
          <p class="lead">My name is Eire (Era) & I used to think I’d be out exploring the world like Indiana Jones - fighting Nazi’s and saving precious artifacts. My life turned out very differently from what I anticipated, but I treasure it every day.<br><br>

            The turning point in my life happened in 2014 when I was raped by my boss, while working in the gallery industry in Chicago. I speak about it openly, & often because what used to be the worst time in my life ultimately guided me to where I am now, building a Health & Wellness Coaching Buisness where I can help guide others to conquer their own struggles.<br><br>

            Each month I host a Virtual Challenge Group where as a team we workout, eat clean, & practice mindfulness TOGETHER. We work through the daily struggles that inherently come with making changes to lead a healthier life. It may not always be easy, but there’s always support, without judgement.<br><br>

            I never thought I’d feel fulfilled with my life if I wasn’t in a museum, but life is funny that way. What brought life back into my soul was focusing on helping mentor others grow into the healthiest, & happiest version of themselves!<br><br>
